00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.300
Excuse me?

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.000
Excuse me, sir? 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.500
Excuse me?

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
Oh, come on.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Do you have a moment, sir?

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.050
I'm kind of in the middle of something here. 
Yes? Thank you.

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:38.950
I've come a long way for you, Franck.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
My name is Victor.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
Hi.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
And you are....

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.500
You are Franck.

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:04.000
You are so much more than just a sheep, aren't you?

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
Oh yeah? How would you know?

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.900
Look at you. You're an adventurer, Franck.

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.000
Just like me, you're... a lone wolf.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000
Tell me, does one choose to be alone?

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
No, one doesn't.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.600
One doesn’t even choose to be a wolf.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
Or does one?

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.800
Well, mister... err... Hector. 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:40.000
Victor. Victor.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:46.000
I don’t know what you’re on about but I'm just 
a sheep minding its own business.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.600
And I suggest you do the same.

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:52.000
No. No no no, Franck. Wait wait wait. 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
No. This is not... the way.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.500
Just give me one minute of your precious time.

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:01.500
Precious time? Hehehe.

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.500
Yeah just give me one minute.

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:06.500
You would have one more minute, wouldn't you?

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
Okay half. Half a minute.

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:29.300
I knew it.
I knew it.

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:32.000
You will not regret this.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
The adventures you will have. 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.500
All the lives you've ever wanted.

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:41.700
All you’ve been missing.

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:46.000
Here. This is... the best product we have... in store.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.000
Variable spin speed, excellent tumble performance...

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.000
...in one... handy... device. Squeaky clean.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.000
Well this... this better be good. 

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
Took me ages to tie that rope.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
With my fucking hooves.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
No more need for hooves.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
No more sheepy business.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.500
Ho! Time flies.

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:16.700
Wait wait wait wait wait wait.

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:18.500
How does this thing work? 

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:21.000
I mean, how do I make it work?

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.500
No you don't.

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:24.000
I just turned it on for you.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.000
When can I go? 

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.000
Where can I go?

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
We will pick you up. Don't worry, just stay here.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
In this exact place.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
Don't move. Just wait.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
That's it?

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:42.000
Hey!

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:44.000
Hey!

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.500
Wait, mister!

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:48.900
Eh, Casper!

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:51.000
Hector whatever!
